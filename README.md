## Simply start your own file host
filehost is a one-click (or one-command) setup file host that you can deploy wherever you want. Full control over your own data. No limits.

Simply run `docker-compose up --build -d` on your server after you've configured the `.env` and it's all up and running.

```
Note: We're still actively working on the product and is currently in early alpha stages. We currently recommend also making a backup or chosing S3 as a host with the project.
```

We also recommend forking the project and deploying your forked version to avoid issues when we push updates. You can then easily merge the changes in your forked version.
